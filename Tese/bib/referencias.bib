	Algumas notas:
	
	
	* These previous studies indicate that the appearance of gloss depends
	not only on the specular luminous flux but also on the particular
	shape of the specular peak of the re-flected light.
	
	* In the present study, we examine the relation of perceived gloss
	to the specular gloss and evaluate the influence of the direction
	of illumination and binocu-larity on this percept.
	
	* (...) technique of maximum likelihood differ-ence scaling (MLDS)
	(Maloney & Yang, 2003) to estimate the evolution of perceived gloss
	as a function of the 10 samples of our gloss series. MLDS has been
	demonstrated to be a robust and reliable technique for estimating
	under-lying perceptual scales.
	
	* We found that the relation between gloss sensation and specular
	gloss value is nonlinear. The human observer is more sensitive to
	variations in the matte and the high glossy regions. Comparison of
	gloss difference scales obtained in monocular and binocular modes
	of vision shows that the sensitivity of the observers is improved
	in binocular vision mainly for the judgment of very glossy samples.
