	1) GNM EXECUTABLE
	
	Usage: gnm [-nd] -i <image_file> -s <image_file> -o <image_file> [-b <image_file>] [-c <cfg_file>] [--help] [--version]

	GNM - Gradient Network Method Segmentation
  	-i, --input=<image_file>  input image filename, preferrably a previously segmented one (PPM or BMP or JPEG)
	-s, --source=<image_file> original image filename, the image used for the initial segmentation (PPM or BMP or JPEG)
	-o, --output=<image_file> output image filename (format specified in the gnm.settings file, if not save as PPM)
	-b, --border=<image_file> image only showing the segmentated regions borders
	-c, --config=<cfg_file>   configuration filename (refer to README file to learn about configuration)
	-n                        disable the post-processing step
	-d                        dump segments statistics and labeled segments files
  	--help                    print this help and exit
	--version                 print version information and exit

	Observation: wxWidgets (www.wxwidgets.org) is used to read and write image files.	
	
  
  2) GNM SETTINGS
  
  Along the GNM executable, it is expected a 'gnm.settings' file. That file allows to set some options not directly related to the segmentation.
  
  The options currently available:
  
  * Selecting output file type: In the following line after 'OUTPUT_TYPE[1=PPM;2=PNG;3=BMP]' specify any of those numbers to select the desired type.
    DEFAULT: 1=PPM
    
  * Selecting the minimum region size threshold for the fragment-cleaning post processing step.
		DEFAULT: 10
	
	* Selecting the maximum region size threshold for the fragment-cleaning post processing step.	
		DEFAULT: 50
	
	* Selecting the color difference threshold for the fragment-cleaning post processing step.
		DEFAULT: 0.5
  
  In the case of 'gnm.settings' is non existent all default options will be loaded.
  
	3) CONFIGURATION FILE
	
	This file will set the alpha, beta and gamma values used in the perception function. Also defines the threshold separating clear and rough perception.
	
	The correct order of the parameters in the configuration file is:
	
	ALPHA - CLEAR PERCEPTION
	BETA - CLEAR PERCEPTION
	GAMMA - CLEAR PERCEPTION
	ALPHA - ROUGH PERCEPTION
	BETA - ROUGH PERCEPTION
	GAMMA - ROUGH PERCEPTION
	THRESHOLD - CLEAR PERCEPTION
	THRESHOLD - ROUGH PERCEPTION
	ROUGH SATURATION THRESHOLD
	MINIMUM LUMINANCE THRESHOLD
	MAXIMUM LUMINANCE THRESHOLD
	
	All these parameters are float values normalized to [0,1] range. Also the sum of alpha, beta and gamma values of a perception must equal to 1.0.
	
	If no configuration file is used, the following values are used by default:
	
	0.7 
	0.2
	0.1
	0.02
	0.0
	0.2
	0.8
	0.08
	0.1
	0.2
	0.95
